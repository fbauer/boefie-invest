* Porting from first python solution to clojure [%]
** The old way
All data and scripts are stored in 
/home/flo/geldanlage/aktienscreen_2013_10_05

1. Download current data from morningstar website by running
   python download_reports.py symbols.csv
2. Move csv data to new directory 
   mkdir data/morningstar/MM_DD_YYY
   mv data/morningstar/*.csv data/morningstar/MM_DD_YYY
3. Patch reporting script to use newest data to generate the report
   Adapt directory constant in morningstar_scraper.py to point to
   newest data dir.
4. Run python morningstar_scraper.py
   A new morningstar.json is generated.
5. Patch exchange rates in graham_enterprising.py
6. Run python graham_enterprising.py morningstar.json > enterprising_results.txt

** Limitations of the old way
- Manual patching of directories, exchange rates etc.
- The scripts choke on csv files that contain info in multiple
  currencies.

** Strategy for the new clojure way[50%]
*** DONE Re-build functionality in morningstar_scraper.py
*** TODO Store info in database
